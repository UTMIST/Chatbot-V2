"There has to be frequent group synergy or I'd get stuck, because I rely on brainstorming with classmates for clarity.",2
"I can only digest material if there's a robust discussion forum with mandatory participation, or I'd fail to reflect on ideas fully.",2
Larger reading blocks don't register for me unless broken into multiple micro-sessions with summary quizzes in between.,2
I must physically practice each concept hands-on; purely listening or observing won't embed the knowledge in my long-term memory.,2
"Without real-time progress checks after each step, I'd be uncertain whether I've misunderstood something, so that's essential.",2
Individual reflection tasks won't help me; I strictly need teacher-led or group-led reflection to process the material.,2
"I need daily flashcard reviews, or I'd forget the content quickly, so frequent spaced repetition is mandatory.",2
Passive content that doesn't challenge me with tasks or questions isn't workable for my learning style at all.,2
"I must see a demonstration of every single concept, or I'd fail to apply it in real situations, so there's no alternative for me.",2

"I must keep lessons below 10 minutes, or I'd fail to find a consistent time slot for them each day.",2

"I only do 10 minutes total a day, so if a single module is that length or beyond, I'd never see the rest of the content.",2
"Spending more than 15 minutes at a time is unworkable, so each lesson must be broken into smaller increments that don't exceed my limit.",2
"I'm fine with 3-minute micro-notes, but I'd be forced out if the course has lumps of 15 minutes or more at once.",2

"All modules must be microbursts of 2-3 minutes, or I'd never slot them into my day in a consistent manner.",2
"I can't do a weekend binge or any 1-hour block approach, so I'd leave the course if it tries to structure content that way.",2
"The absolute maximum I can handle is 5 minutes thrice a week, so if the course demands daily presence, I'm out.",2

"I can't accommodate changes; if it's more than 5 minutes at a time, I'd have to forfeit the entire plan.",2
"I only have availability for 15 minutes once a week, so the course can't push more sessions on other days.",2
"I cannot do multiple short sessions; it must be precisely one 5-minute window every other day, or I'm done.",2
"If the final project demands hours of work, I'd have to quit, because there's no chance I can allocate that time.",2
"I'm restricted to no more than 10 minutes total weekly, so it must be micro lessons strictly curated around that limit.",2
I won't look at anything that requires daily attendance beyond 2 minutes; my entire schedule is too rigid to allow more.,2
"Any instructions that suggest a continuous half-hour session won't work for me, so it's mandatory to keep them way shorter.",2
I'm at my limit with 5 minutes of study once a day; there's no option to extend or do multiple sessions in one day.,2
"If the material is delivered in a 20-minute block, I'm done, because I'd never find that block in my normal routine.",2

"I can't merge multiple small lessons into a bigger chunk, so each must remain individually under 5 minutes or I won't do them.",2
"I need to confirm everything is taught in micro lessons under 10 minutes total a day, or I'd never open the modules at all.",2
"I'm not in a position to rearrange for a 1-hour workshop, so the course has to revolve around micro-sessions under 15 minutes each.",2
"I have no tolerance for any session that runs 20 minutes straight, so I'd drop if it's not broken down into smaller parts.",2
"I require extremely short daily modules, as any request to do a 30-minute or longer session means I'd leave the course.",2
"Multiple tasks summing over 10 minutes a day won't work, so it needs to be a single, minimal session, or I'm out.",2
"Without daily 5-minute content, I'd be forced to skip days and fail, so it must conform strictly to that format.",2
"I do not have the capacity for 2-hour monthly sessions or anything that lumps content heavily, so it's a non-starter for me.",2
"If the lessons require I watch 15-minute videos in one sitting, I'm finished, because I can't block that time at all.",2
"I must allocate no more than 5 minutes to each topic, so if a topic demands 6 or 7 minutes, I'd never finish it fully.",2
"It's essential that no single learning unit surpasses 10 minutes total; otherwise, I'd fail to keep pace with daily tasks.",2
"I'm not able to rearrange or skip around content, so if there's a large mandatory block, I'd have to give up right away.",2
"I can only do micro-labs of 2 minutes each; bigger labs aren't feasible in my line of work, so I'd be forced out if they're necessary.",2
Time constraints won't let me read or watch anything over 5 minutes; I'd exit the program if a module is longer than that.,2
"I'm obliged to daily duties, so I'd fail if the course needs a single session beyond 10 minutes at once.",2
"I must keep every study instance to 3 minutes or below, or I'd be missing essential chores and won't keep up the course at all.",2
"If there's a summary that takes more than 5 minutes, I'd skip it, effectively losing track, so it has to remain super short.",2
"I can't meet a schedule that lumps lessons into weekly 1-hour classes, so I'd be out if that's the default format.",2
"It must align with a 5-minute daily routine or I'm done, because I can't shift other responsibilities around at all.",2
"I'm restricted to an extremely strict timeline; if the course doesn't break down into tiny portions under 10 minutes, I won't manage it.",2
I require an absolute max of 15 minutes for the entire week; there's no flexibility for extra sessions or expansions.,2
"I generally prefer a moderately thorough explanation, but I'm fine if we occasionally go either deeper or shallower when it makes sense.",1

"While I'd love robust detail, it's okay if only the main points are emphasized for simpler sections.",1
"I prefer at least mid-level depth, but I'm fine if the occasional lesson stays closer to an overview.",1
"I enjoy exploring nuances, though I'd cope if some modules remain quite basic to save time.",1
"I'm open to a decent analysis, yet I'd accept if certain chapters are just outlines without extensive elaboration.",1
"I like to see the bigger picture thoroughly, but I'd handle some parts being more succinct or skipping the nitty-gritty.",1
"I enjoy dissecting topics, but it's not a deal-breaker if we keep a portion of the course at an entry-level viewpoint.",1
"I would appreciate in-depth coverage, though I'm not rigid if the format leans a bit more general in places.",1
"I'm partial to going deeper, yet I'd be flexible if we keep certain lessons more straightforward for clarity.",1
"I typically enjoy deeper knowledge, but I'd manage if we remain at an intermediate scope to cater to everyone.",1
"I wouldn't mind advanced coverage, though I'd accept if the course doesn't push far beyond the fundamentals in all topics.",1
"I like thorough dives, but I'm okay if the course occasionally glosses over advanced details that aren't critical.",1
"I'm comfortable exploring complexities, but I'd be open to a simpler approach in some cases, so I'm not strict.",1
"I benefit from moderate to advanced detail, although I'd accept an outline approach for minor subtopics.",1
"I prefer an in-depth style, but I'd adapt if the course occasionally chooses a summary-level approach for certain segments.",1
"Depth is interesting to me, but I'm flexible with a shallow overview for sections deemed less essential.",1
"I lean toward fairly involved explanations, yet I'm not bothered if certain simpler lessons remain at a high level.",1
"I appreciate robust coverage, though I'd live with skipping a few advanced corners if time doesn't permit.",1

"Though I'd like to thoroughly dissect the material, I'd manage if we maintain an intermediate approach overall.",1
"I prefer a detailed journey, yet I'd be all right if some chapters are a swift overview to keep up pace.",1
"I am fine if we hover around mid-level detail, though I'd enjoy a deeper perspective on certain tricky areas as well.",1
"I appreciate a mostly comprehensive view, but I'm not strict if some content remains slightly superficial to save time.",1
"I favor deeper dives, but it's not a must for every single concept; I'll still follow if we lighten up occasionally.",1
"I like quite a bit of background info, though I'd accept if not all topics are heavily elaborated due to length constraints.",1
"I typically want advanced detail, but I'd be flexible if the course isn't geared toward extremely in-depth coverage on every module.",1
"I enjoy digging into complexities, though I'm cool with a simpler approach for straightforward topics.",1
"I like the chance to explore multiple layers, but I'd be patient if we only do a high-level pass in certain areas.",1

"I love detail, though I'm open to a general overview in chapters that aren't as critical or that I'd revisit later.",1
"Mostly I'd like to see thorough coverage, but I'd be okay with a breezy approach for secondary topics if that's what's needed.",1
"I prefer deep analysis, yet I'm not against the course skipping certain advanced angles that might be tangential.",1
"I usually aim for more than a surface view, but I'm not adamant if time constraints keep us from diving too deeply in each lesson.",1

"I'm usually drawn to detailed breakdowns, but I'd be fine accepting shorter, more superficial coverage if needed in some spots.",1
"I think a moderately deep approach is best, but I'd be all right with only partial expansions in specialized topics.",1
"I want to see more than an introduction, but I'd adapt if only some lessons offer a comprehensive deep dive while others are basic.",1
"I prefer diving deeper, though I'm not upset if certain chapters remain quite general or skip advanced intricacies.",1
"A balanced approach between thorough and concise is ideal for me, and I'd handle it if some modules remain more high level.",1

"I'd rather go beyond the basics, but I'm not rigid if the main plan is to keep it at a mostly intermediate level.",1
"I enjoy a thorough approach, but I'd adapt if we only do an in-depth analysis on the more central topics, leaving others brief.",1

"Balance is key: I'd like a deeper look, yet if the program doesn't delve deeply into every corner, I'll still manage.",1
"I do lean toward advanced coverage, but it's not an issue if we keep it accessible with fewer deep tangents in some chapters.",1
"I can handle fairly in-depth material, but I'd be okay if the course remains on a mild or moderate detail level overall.",1
"Although I'm curious about advanced intricacies, I'd cope if we keep those sections short or optional for those who want it.",1

"I prefer going beyond the basics, but I'd manage if certain optional complexities are left out for brevity.",1
"I want moderate detail at minimum, though I'd be happy if advanced sections come as an optional reading for further exploration.",1
"I typically lean toward thorough coverage, yet I'd be flexible if the course remains mostly an overview with some deeper modules.",1
"I like to explore complexities, but if the structure is more fundamental, I'd still make it work and learn what I can.",1

"I prefer fairly detailed lessons, though I'd keep an open mind if the instructor streamlines them to a more superficial level in some areas.",1
"I normally want a thorough breakdown, though I'd accept if certain subtopics are summarized lightly to maintain momentum.",1
"I appreciate deeper insights, but I'd be okay if the focus stays on main concepts with minimal branching into advanced complexities.",1
"A well-rounded coverage is ideal, though I'm not demanding a full deep dive on each nuance if time is constrained.",1
"I'm up for exploring advanced topics, but I'm not disappointed if we only do a moderate-level approach for the majority.",1
"I like thorough explanations, but I'd accept a simpler outline for some modules if that helps keep the course on track.",1
"I gravitate toward advanced detail, but I'm open to the instructor's choice if a more mid-level approach is best for clarity.",1
"I enjoy complexities, though I'd handle a high-level approach for less relevant subtopics if that's how the course is built.",1
"For me, moderate depth is fine, and I'd be okay if there's occasional deeper expansions or shallower coverage as well.",1
"I prefer an in-depth style typically, though I'd settle for simpler coverage if we have limited time or a broad scope to address.",1

"I'm fine with a relatively moderate or advanced approach, but I'd also be okay if only a portion is thoroughly dissected.",1
"I love layered explanations, yet I'm open to minimal coverage of specialized topics that aren't central to my main goals.",1
"Going deeper is usually my preference, but I'd adapt if the official plan keeps everything at an intermediate or simpler level.",1
"I expect more than a cursory introduction, yet I'd be calm if we don't dive into every advanced corner systematically.",1
"I can handle advanced theory, but I'd be fine if the course remains partially shallow to keep it approachable for everyone.",1
"I do well with thorough coverage, but I'd be flexible if we skip details that won't drastically affect understanding.",1
"I'm drawn to detail, though I'd let it slide if the instructor aims for broad conceptual coverage more than intricacy.",1
"A mainly mid-level approach is perfect, but I'd enjoy deeper expansions or simpler outlines depending on the chapter's complexity.",1
"I appreciate thoroughness, yet I'd accept if certain niche aspects are bypassed or only briefly mentioned.",1
"I like going step by step, but I'm not demanding an ultra-deep dive into every nuance; an overall moderate approach is enough.",1
"I usually thrive on detail, though I'd handle a surface-level pass if that's the chosen style for certain modules.",1
"I'm content with a moderate or deeper approach, but if the trainer chooses to keep it high-level, I'll still learn effectively.",1
"I favor an in-depth angle, but it's not mandatory for every lesson to be advanced; a mix is okay for me.",1
"I like thorough background info, but I'd survive a shallower overview if we move quickly through certain sections.",1
"Deep coverage is interesting, but I'm not fixated on it if the main objective is a simpler or broad understanding for the group.",1
"A moderate depth is enough for me, though I'd adapt if the course occasionally goes deeper or remains quite general in places.",1
I need everything to be extremely advanced and comprehensive; a shallow overview won't meet my expectations at all.,2
"It absolutely must stay very high-level, because I don't want or need any deep dives into micro-details.",2
"I insist on a fully thorough approach with absolutely no skipping of any advanced subtopic, or I'll lose interest quickly.",2
"There should be no deep details—only an absolute surface-level summary, or I'll be overwhelmed and drop out.",2
I require an exhaustive analysis of every facet; anything less than complete thoroughness won't be acceptable for me.,2
I won't settle for partial coverage; the lessons have to cover advanced theories in detail for each concept.,2
"I want strictly a bird's-eye perspective, meaning no heavy elaboration or extensive background that drags on.",2
"Without deep theoretical foundations in each area, I'm not continuing; every underlying principle must be explained fully.",2
"I cannot tolerate advanced complexities—keep it purely minimal with just the key points, or I can't follow.",2
"It must remain ultra-specific and detailed, with no point left uncovered, or I won't get what I need from this course.",2
"I only want a lightweight overview that never dives beneath the surface, or I'll feel it's too complicated to keep up.",2
There is no room for a shallow summary; the material must be thoroughly dissected down to advanced elements in every module.,2
"I'm only here for the broad strokes, so any advanced breakdown will instantly turn me away.",2
"I require maximum depth in all topics, from start to finish, with zero omissions or simplified sections allowed.",2
"Everything must be summarized at a top-level; if there's heavy detail, I'll be completely lost.",2
"I demand a deep, intricate approach, or I'll find the course too basic to be worth my time.",2
"My only interest is extremely shallow coverage, so if the teacher goes into deeper complexities, I'm out.",2
"It's absolutely necessary that we examine the advanced aspects thoroughly, ignoring simpler overviews for novices.",2
"I can't handle deep content, so it must remain broad and superficial with no intricate or extended elaborations.",2
I must have a heavily detailed structure that leaves no stone unturned; a mere overview won't suffice for me.,2
"If there's any advanced detail, I'd struggle and quit, so it strictly must remain at a superficial introduction level.",2
"I want the highest possible depth, with each concept fully expanded and analyzed to the smallest detail, or I won't find value.",2
I require a succinct summary with no advanced expansions; I'd be overwhelmed by complexities and would have to drop out otherwise.,2
"Don't skip or simplify anything—cover everything in advanced, methodical detail, or I'll lose motivation entirely.",2
"I only want a big-picture perspective with no diving deeper into theory or complexities, so keep it basic.",2
"No high-level shortcuts—I need thorough, advanced breakdowns in every lesson, or it's not worth doing for me.",2
"I prefer not to see complicated detail, so everything must remain at an easy, minimal coverage approach only.",2
I insist on fully advanced content; minimal or moderate coverage of the subject won't satisfy my learning requirements.,2
"I want no deeper expansions—just a fundamental overview, or I'll be frustrated by too much complexity.",2
"It must be deeply exhaustive, from theory to practice, with no bits glossed over, or I won't be able to thoroughly master it.",2
"My aim is strictly a basic summary, so advanced analysis or thorough elaboration is not an option for me at all.",2
"I require comprehensive detail, including every advanced corner of the subject matter, or I'll find it incomplete.",2
"I need a super-high-level approach with minimal elaboration, or I'd be out of my depth and forced to leave.",2
"If the course doesn't approach each topic in a deeply technical manner, I'm not going to stay enrolled.",2

"I can't handle advanced material, so everything must remain strictly basic or I'm out of this course for good.",2
"Every chapter should be extremely detailed and technical, or I'd consider it incomplete for my needs.",2
I want a purely surface-level glance at each concept; advanced expansions or in-depth topics will be too much for me.,2

"I must see an advanced, systematic approach that leaves no detail out, or I'd fail to build the comprehensive knowledge I want.",2
"I can't accommodate deeper topics, so the content must remain at a broad summary or I'd be overwhelmed.",2
"I'm demanding an all-encompassing, advanced coverage that doesn't shy away from deeper nuances in every chapter.",2
This must not exceed a basic overview; advanced coverage would be beyond my capacity to comprehend and keep up.,2

"A purely broad overview is all I'm after, so deep exploration would prove too time-consuming and dissuade me.",2
"Every detail, from basics to advanced theory, must be included thoroughly, or I'll consider the course incomplete.",2
Keep it minimal: I can't handle the details that go beyond a superficial highlight of each concept.,2
"Only a deep, systematic approach satisfies me, so there's no room for skipping advanced subtopics in any lesson.",2
"I want to remain at an overview level the entire time, so I'd drop the course if it tries to deep-dive in any part.",2
"For me, skipping detail is unacceptable; it must be totally comprehensive, covering each advanced point without compromise.",2
I prefer to stay in the shallow end; any deeper or advanced expansions would push me out of my comfort zone entirely.,2
I need maximum thoroughness—it's imperative that the course not omit any in-depth coverage of core theories.,2
I'm not looking for advanced coverage; I'd fail to follow if we venture beyond the absolute basics and main concepts.,2
A purely advanced route is essential; no simplified overview or partial coverage can exist if I'm to remain interested.,2
"I strictly want a big-picture narrative, so I'd quit if the lesson plan includes micro-level technical details.",2
"Everything must be meticulously thorough, or I'd feel shortchanged because I'm aiming for the highest mastery possible.",2

"For me, skipping advanced detail is not an option—cover absolutely every angle in detail or I'd be disappointed.",2
"I'm allergic to deep complexity, so I'd abandon the course if it tries to exceed a plain, simplified coverage.",2
"I want a purely advanced standpoint for every single concept, or I'd see no reason to invest my time here.",2
"Any attempt at diving deeper than essential bullet points would be too much for my needs, so I'd have to drop it.",2
I won't be satisfied unless we investigate the underlying complexities thoroughly and systematically at every stage.,2
"A quick summary is my only interest, so advanced breakdowns or heavily detailed modules won't work for me.",2
My requirement is a deeply complex approach with absolutely no superficial skipping of crucial advanced insights.,2
I won't accept advanced sections in the curriculum; it all has to remain fundamental or I'd lose track entirely.,2
"It must remain comprehensive, covering theoretical depth at the highest level, with no part relegated to a simple overview.",2
"I prefer the simplest overview possible, so I'd be put off if the teacher includes multi-layered or deep-theory sessions.",2
"I require advanced detail from the get-go, focusing on thorough theoretical and practical coverage at every step.",2
"A broad, high-level orientation is my only goal, so I'd be overwhelmed by any deep or advanced expansions outside that scope.",2
"If the course doesn't offer an in-depth look at each subtopic, I'd see it as incomplete and likely drop out.",2
I can't proceed if we're forced to read or interpret advanced detail—my preference is strictly the basics and no more.,2
Everything must remain as deep and intricate as possible—glossing over advanced aspects is absolutely not acceptable.,2
"I can't handle more than the top-level outline, so I'd have to quit if the instructor tries to go in-depth anywhere.",2
"A fully thorough, deeply technical approach is my only route—anything short of that won't hold my attention for long.",2
"I want a minimal approach that never covers complex subtopics, or I'd be lost and forced to discontinue.",2
Leaving out advanced details is a non-starter for me; it's essential we thoroughly examine each intricacy to be complete.,2
"I only want the single-sentence big picture, so if there's a plan to dissect each topic deeply, I'd skip the course.",2
"I need a hyper-detailed perspective, from fundamentals to advanced expansions, or I'd not learn anything of real substance.",2
"Even an intermediate dive is too much for me—I strictly require the most superficial coverage possible, no advanced additions.",2
"I refuse to accept a course that doesn't go full depth in every lesson, as I'm looking for a truly advanced training experience.",2
"I need a purely entry-level overview, so if the teacher tries to incorporate deeper or more thorough detail, it's not for me.",2
"Don't skip a single advanced corner; I need the maximum possible depth in each module, or I'll find it inadequate.",2
"Anything beyond the initial surface is beyond my scope, so we must keep it shallow at all costs.",2
"I can only function with an in-depth, heavily theoretical approach, so a basic or moderate path won't meet my standard.",2
"My interest is only in a quick, shallow orientation to the topic; thorough coverage or advanced complexity is not acceptable.",2
"Unless the course is highly detailed and advanced, I'd consider it lacking, and I'd drop right away.",2
"Any approach that tries to dive deeper than bullet points won't work for me, so I'd have to leave if it gets complicated.",2
"I explicitly need advanced-level theory in every lesson, not just an overview, or it won't be fulfilling enough.",2
"A short summary is all I want, so I'd abandon the program if we go even moderately deeper than that initial outline.",2
"If there's no fully thorough, complex explanation each time, I'd feel shortchanged; I want advanced coverage guaranteed.",2
Steering away from deep detail is mandatory for me; advanced expansions would make me drop out immediately.,2
"I must have total depth: the entire approach must treat each subtopic with advanced scrutiny, no skipping allowed.",2
I want only minimal coverage; anything significantly more advanced or complicated is a deal-breaker for me.,2
A surface-level pass is useless to me; I must have intricately detailed expansions in each lesson or I'll be dissatisfied.,2
"I'm not open to hearing about complexities or deeper-level discussions, so keep it strictly top-level or I'm gone.",2
"I expect the course to dissect every nuance, or I'll find it too shallow and worthless for my advanced goals.",2
"One-liner summaries are my sole preference, so any further elaboration would cause me to drop the course.",2
No topic can be left at a superficial explanation—I need everything fully expanded with advanced depth in this program.,2

"I can handle text transcripts, but I must have videos showing practical demos, or I'm leaving right away.",2
"Recording from live Zoom calls is mandatory; if everything is just reading or pre-recorded, I'll find another course.",2
"If there's no centralized app that updates my progress, I won't track it properly, so I'd be forced to drop out.",2
"I only consume content via audio format, so if there's no legitimate podcast approach, I'm not able to continue here.",2
I can't work with slides or e-books; the entire program must revolve around a single podcast feed for me to follow along.,2

"I need detailed daily emails, or I'd forget to do the lessons, so I'm dropping this if we rely on a single website instead.",2
It has to be a structured MOOC platform like Coursera or edX; random email attachments or PDFs won't interest me.,2
"I can only read text-based HTML with large fonts, so if there's a reliance on videos or PDFs, I'd leave right away.",2
I won't touch partial audio transcripts; I need fully narrated audio or I'm not going to absorb the material properly.,2

"I only do well with a standard e-learning SCORM-based setup, so I'd exit if we rely on random YouTube links or blog posts.",2
I'm not willing to do text-based submissions; everything must be verbally or video-based to match my learning approach.,2
"Unless there's a smartphone app that tracks my daily progress, I'd lose interest, so it's non-negotiable for me.",2

"I can only handle reading offline documents, so I'd skip if it's reliant on streaming or an always-online approach.",2
"If we don't do a live webinar each week, I'd see no point in paying attention, so I'll leave if that isn't guaranteed.",2
Each module must be a single PDF containing that topic fully; I'd be lost if we break it up across multiple mediums or pages.,2
I only watch short animations; I'd drop out if it's just talking-head videos or purely static slides with voiceover.,2
"I need a text-only format with zero multimedia because of my limited data plan, or I'd be forced to drop out.",2
"All content must be consolidated on one website with a login portal—no emailing or scattered docs allowed, or I'm gone.",2
I cannot function without a final exam in an online proctored format; I'd quit if there's no official test at the end.,2
Slack threads are mandatory for me to discuss daily progress; I'd end my enrollment if we rely on email or forum only.,2

"If there's no video annotation or possibility to see slides in tandem with audio, I'd never keep the flow, so I'd drop out.",2
I do not accept purely web-based instruction; everything must be supplied in a compiled offline format for my device.,2
"A synchronous schedule with mandatory attendance on Zoom is essential, or I'd find no accountability and I'd drop.",2
I won't consider doing random blog posts; there must be a professionally designed e-learning environment with lessons and a dashboard.,2

"I must have an offline DVD or USB with videos, because I lack stable internet for streaming or accessing a website repeatedly.",2
"I only trust formal textbook chapters authored in a standard format, so I'd skip if we rely on simpler guides or unverified sources.",2
"Everything must come via an official learning management system that tracks quizzes, or I'd have no interest in partial solutions.",2
I require short daily video tasks with embedded quizzes—I won't do weekly text dumps or all-in-one big readings.,2
"Unless every concept is explained live with a teacher on video, I'd prefer not to attempt it in a purely text-based manner.",2
"Even though I'd love the lessons in French, I'm okay with a bit of Spanish or English in the mix.",1
"I cannot install anything unless it is fully compatible with Windows 7, so that is my firm requirement.",2
"I have only minimal math exposure, but I'll do fine if there's a gentle introduction first.",1
"I need screen readers to work across every module, or I won't be able to interpret the material at all.",2
